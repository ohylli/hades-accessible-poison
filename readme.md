# Hades accessible poison

This is a small accessiblity mod for the game Hades. It is intended for blind players to be used with the [existing accessiblity mods](https://hllf.net/hades/). Its purpose is to make it more easier for the player to detect when they become poisoned. This is done by making Zagreus to always say a voice line related to being poisoned. Normally this happened only occasionally and there was a cool down period between voice lines. Note that this is still not 100 % certain to work. If Zagreus is saying something else when he becomes poisoned he will not speak the being poisoned voice line.

## Requirements and installation

Mod Util and Mod Importer used with the other accessiblity mods are required. The installation process is also the same:
